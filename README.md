# GRBL-Plotter
[README deutsch](README_de.md)  
A GCode sender for GRBL under windows, using DotNET 4.0 (should also work with Windows XP)  
Written in C# VisualStudio 2015.
 
### New in version 1.1.3.0: 
Add feed rate and spindle speed override buttons (GRBL 1.1) to main GUI  
Bug fix in main GUI: no zooming during streaming - disabled background image (perhaps performance in Win-XP is affected)  
Bug fix SVG Import: rectangle transform (G3 in roundrect) was bad  
Bug fix SVG Import: missing end of GCode path before next SVG subpath starts  
Bug fix routing error-message during streaming (or code check) from serialform to main GUI  
  
### New in version 1.1.2.0: 
Import of SVG graphics or Image via Ctrl-V 'Paste' into GRBL-Plotter   
Copy SVG data from "URL imported SVG" to clipboard for pasting into inkscape   
Check for GRBL-Plotter update   
SVG-Import bug fix  
  
### New in version 1.1.1.0: 
Zooming into graphic  
New font ['Dot Matrix'](https://youtu.be/ip_qCQwoufw)   
Option for SVG-Import 'Process path nodes only' usefull for ['String Art'](https://youtu.be/ymWi15rvTvM)  
Support of 4th axis  
SVG-Import bug fix

#### [GRBL-Plotter Vers. 1.1.3.0](GRBL-Plotter_1130_Publish.zip)  2018-01-03  

### Requirements for compiling
* VisualStudio 2015 
* DotNET 4.0
 
### Features:
* Supporting GRBL 1.1 (and 0.9 also)
* Controlling a 2nd GRBL-Hardware
* Supports 4th axis (A, B, C, U, V or W). Status and control (special GRBL version needed)
* Axis Substitution for Rotary Axis
* Surface scanning for height map creation and Autoleveling
  
  
* GCode import via file load, drag & drop or copy & paste
  - Loading GCode with optional replacement of M3 / M4 commands (helpful for 'Laser Mode' $32=1)
* SVG graphics import via file load, drag & drop (also URL) or copy & paste
* DXF graphics import via file load, drag & drop (also URL)
* Image import via file load, drag & drop (also URL) or copy & paste
* GCode generation from Text (Hershey Font)
* GCode generation from simple shape
* Several options to translate Pen Up/Down
  - controlling a Z axis
  - controlling a servo
  - controlling a laser
  - user defined commands
  - Create GCode absolute or relative (for further use as subroutine)  
    
    
* Transformation of GCodes (scale, rotation, mirror, zero-Offset)
* Supporting subroutines M98, M99 Sub-Program Call (P, L)
* GCode can be edited and saved
* User defined Buttons - GCode from text-field or file
* Joystick like control
* Export / import machine specific settings (Joystick, Buttons)
* Automatic reconnect on program start
* Recent File List (Files and URLs)
* 2-dimensional preview
* Optional usage of a WebCam with graphics overlay of the current GCode, set zero point, measure angle, zoom
* Internal variable to support probing, e.g.:
  - G38.3 Z-50		(probe toward tool length sensor, stop on contact - because of decelaration stop-pos. is not trigger-pos.)
  - G43.1 Z@PRBZ	(Offset Tool with value stored on trigger of sensor switch)
  - examine SerialForm.cs for implementation
